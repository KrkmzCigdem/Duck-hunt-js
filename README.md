# Duck Hunt Instructions

# Start the Game:
Click the "PLAY" button to begin.
You will hear a welcome sound, and the game will start immediately.

# Control Your Aim:
Mouse Controls: Move your mouse to control the crosshair on the screen.
Keyboard Controls: Use the arrow keys to move the crosshair.
Press the spacebar to shoot.

# Objective:
Your goal is to shoot the ducks flying across the screen before time runs out or you lose all your lives.

# Scoring Points:
Shoot the ducks by clicking on them with your mouse or using the spacebar if controlling the aim with the keyboard.
Each duck gives different points based on the difficulty to hit them.
Your score will be updated at the top-right corner of the screen.

# Lives:
You start with 3 lives.
If you miss a duck while using the keyboard, or if a projectile hits your crosshair, you will lose a life.
When you run out of lives, the game will end.

# Time Limit:
You have 30 seconds to score as many points as possible.
The timer will be displayed at the top-right of the screen.
If the time reaches zero, the game ends.

# Game Over:
If you lose all your lives or run out of time, a "Game Over" message will appear showing your final score.
You can restart the game after it ends.

# Projectiles:
Random projectiles will fall from the top of the screen.
Avoid these by moving your crosshair to prevent losing a life.

# High Score:
The game tracks your highest score, which is displayed at the bottom of the screen.
Try to beat your own high score!

# Pause/Resume the Game:
Press the "Escape" key to pause or resume the game.
A pause menu will allow you to either continue or restart the game.

# Good luck and have fun hunting ducks!
